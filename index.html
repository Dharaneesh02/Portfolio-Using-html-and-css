                         <h2>DHARANEESH N</h2>
                         <p>I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, 
                               so I have something to strive towards. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m 
                               always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. 
                               I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source 
                               of motivation that drives me to do my best. This passion led me to 
                               challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. 
                               For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our 
                               photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design needs.</p>
